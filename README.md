- Reinforcement Learning is  set of Intersection of many different science.
- What is rienforcment learning?
- Its a Science of descion making.
- In computer science its come under the section of machine learning
- In Engineering its come under the name of Optimal Control
- Optimal control descides the best sequence of action for any task to get the best result
-  In Neuro Science the great research is that how human brain works , Neuro transmit the dopamine actually reflects to on of the main algorithm called Reward system
- In psychology the study of classical/operant conditioning which is   about how animal behaviour when we gave some rewards. Its also underline in the RL
-  In mathamatics the study which is named as Operations Research , which focous on the study of optimal control.
- In  Economics the study of game theory/ utility theory and bounded rationality which focous on how and why people made descions if they want to optimise there utility.
